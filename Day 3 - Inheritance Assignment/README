Inheritance Assignment
Today's assignment will focus on Inheritance. We will create a new contract that will extend the
functionality of our HelloWorld contract. Therefore, to complete this assignment, we should make
no changes to the Base aka HelloWorld Contract (except one small exception).

What we are creating today is not a very useful application, but it is a good assignment on Inheritance.
You will learn about better ways to store unique information on the blockchain further down the curriculum.

For clarity, start by renaming your contract from HelloWorld to People. You can also disregard our
External.sol file, we won't be using it anymore. 

Then, create a file with new contract called Workers, which should inherit from People. Then implement the 
functionality listed below. When you are done. Hand in a link to your code to Google Classroom for the 
Inheritance Assignment.

The Workers-contract should have the following functions and properties:

 - Should inherit from the People Contract. 
 - Should extend the People contract by adding another mapping called salary which maps an address to an 
   integer. 
 - Have a createWorker function which is a wrapper function for the createPerson function. Make sure to 
   figure out the correct visibility level for the createPerson function (it should no longer be public).
   This is the only modification we should do in the People contract.
- Apart from calling the createPerson function, the createWorker function should also set the salary for 
  the Worker in the new mapping.
- When creating a worker, the persons age should not be allowed to be over 75. 
- Implement a fire function, which removes the worker from the contract.

Bonus Assignment

- Make sure that a worker can only be fired by his/her boss. For each worker created, you need to input 
  and save information about who (which address) is the boss. This should be implemented in the Worker 
  contract.
- A worker is not allowed to be his/her own boss. 
- By implementing a new function in the base contract, used by both deletePerson and fire, make sure 
  there is as little code duplication as possible between the deletePerson function and the fire function.
