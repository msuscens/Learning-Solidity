People Update Assignment
In today's assignment, I want you to add some extra functionality to our Helloworld contract.
I want you to use the original contract that I use in the videos, not the modified one you created
in the assignment yesterday.

Before you do this assignment, you should already have added an event to your createPerson function,
as I did in the Event video.

Create an event that is called personUpdated. This will be called whenever someone updates their
information in the mapping. It should contain both the new information and the old information.
The createPerson function now works for both creating and for updating a persons information. In both
cases, the function will emit a personCreated event. I want you to modify this function so that if the
msg.sender updates their information, we should emit a personUpdated event instead.
This means that if there already is information in the mapping for the msg.sender, this is now a call
to update the person's information and we should therefore emit the personUpdated event.

Go to Google Classroom and read how to submit your code.
